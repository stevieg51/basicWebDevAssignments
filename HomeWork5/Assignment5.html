                     <p id="text1">Since the age of 12, I have always indulged in the delectable beverage, “coffee”. I was introduced to this beverage through my parents who also drink it everyday; It was to be used of a means for me to wake early enough to get both me and my little brother prepared for school. Today I enjoy this caffeinated all day everyday, and have even tried experimenting with creating my own. </p>

                    <p id="text2">Weightlifting is something I hold close and dear to me. I was formerly an obese kid; I lost a lot of weight at the age of 12 years old because of bullying and found bodybuilding through old Sylvester Stallone videos. Since then, I have continuously trained daily. I have competed in both powerlifting and bodybuilding, have set state records, and have won first in my classes. </p>

                     <p id="text3">Mountains, mountains, and more mountains! I love the mountains. This is because mountains usually have a very cool, quiet, and brisk atmosphere. Living in PA up until the age of 14, I often find myself daydreaming about the winters when we would venture into the mountains to bring home wood for our woodstove or watch the endless crystal flakes fall from the sky from within our house. </p>
